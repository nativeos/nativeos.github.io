  <p>
  Running NativeOS on real hardware is not supported. Remember at all
  times: this software is under development and may have bugs. The software
  is provided with no warranties. Don't blame on me for data or PC loss
  if your hard drive gets deleted or if your system blows up.

1. Dump the CD-ROM contents into an USB drive or burn the ISO file contents
   into a real CD or DVD and attach it to a x86 compatible PC able to boot
   from BIOS. Alternatively, get VirtualBox, QEMU, Microsoft Virtual PC or
   a similar virtual machine tool.

2. Admire the black screen.

3. Once you get tired of admiring the black screen, keep the physical ON
   button of your computer pressed a few seconds to turn off the computer.
   If you are running the ISO inside a virtual machine, close the virtual
   machine.
